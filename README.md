# melazzinipablo.github.io Portfolio Website.
This web page will be considered as my first step in becoming a Full Stack Developer with MERN.
## Description:
This Website will show three projects that I worked on the first module of the MIT xPro Program and will serve as a guide line of my abilities in Web development.
## How to Run:
In the First page you will see an embedded youtube video as well as a small biography of myself, the page has a Navbar which will take you to a second page containing the projects and links to the repos and the live demo of each project.
## Future improvements:
Make more web improvements as I learn them.
